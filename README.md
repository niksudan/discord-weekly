# Discord Weekly

Create a weekly Spotify playlist from Discord server messages

## Overview

This bot retrieves the last week's worth of songs in a channel and then updates a Spotify playlist with the results.

Song are added to the playlist if it is in one of the following formats:

- Spotify track URL
- YouTube video URL
- Apple Music track URL
- SoundCloud track URL

After each new playlist, a message is posted to a channel that will show the following information:

- Popular artists (with total tracks)
- Dominant genres (with percentages)
- Most liked tracks (with total like score)
- Top contributors (with total contributions)
- Number of tracks & playlist link

## Reacting to Songs

If a song gets reacted with a üëç, this is counted as a **like**. The more likes a song gets, the higher it will appear in the playlist.

If a song gets reacted with a üëé, this is counted as a **dislike**. This subtracts from the total number of likes. If a song is disliked enough, it will not appear in the playlist.

## Installation

Discord Weekly is a self-hosted bot, so you will need some server-side knowledge before installing.
